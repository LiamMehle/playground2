Kyriu Coco, thank you for the years of entertainment, for being you. For pushing the limits occasionally and getting away with it. For chearing us up when we were feeling down.

For bringing Jp and En together. For doing your best.

We all missed you since your last stream, and as we can see, the flame kept burning for the last 3 months.

People are still becoming members, despite your last public appearance being long ago.

We love you, we miss you, and we hope you're still doing well.
Best of luck.

楽しかった。
ありが-thanks ござい-much、 会長さま。
仕事頑張れ。
さよなら。o7
